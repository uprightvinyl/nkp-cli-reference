# `nkp completion zsh`

```text
Generate the autocompletion script for the zsh shell.

If shell completion is not already enabled in your environment you will need
to enable it.  You can execute the following once:

	echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >> ~/.zshrc

To load completions in your current shell session:

	source <(nkp completion zsh)

To load completions for every new session, execute once:

#### Linux:

	nkp completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_nkp"

#### macOS:

	nkp completion zsh > $(brew --prefix)/share/zsh/site-functions/_nkp

You will need to start a new shell for this setup to take effect.

Usage:
  nkp completion zsh [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help              Help for zsh
      --no-descriptions   disable completion descriptions

Global Flags:
  -v, --verbose int   Output verbosity
```
