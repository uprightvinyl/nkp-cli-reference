# `nkp completion bash`

```text
Generate the autocompletion script for the bash shell.

This script depends on the 'bash-completion' package.
If it is not installed already, you can install it via your OS's package manager.

To load completions in your current shell session:

	source <(nkp completion bash)

To load completions for every new session, execute once:

#### Linux:

	nkp completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/nkp

#### macOS:

	nkp completion bash > $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion.d/nkp

You will need to start a new shell for this setup to take effect.

Usage:
  nkp completion bash

Flags:
  -h, --help              Help for bash
      --no-descriptions   disable completion descriptions

Global Flags:
  -v, --verbose int   Output verbosity
```
